          At its inception in 1990, <strong>HTML</strong> was only intended to provide structure
          for text-based documents. It had a concept of multiple levels of
          headings and of body text, but not much else.<br>HTML 2.0 was released in
          April 1994 and approved by the W3C as a standard in September of 1995,
          and it brought images. Developers were given very little control over
          how images were displayed. In fact, image tags supported only two
          attributes: One for the image source (providing a URL than the image
          could be downloaded from) and one for the alt text (a message to be
          shown to the user if the image could not be displayed for some
          reason). <br>HTML 3.0, released in November 1993, added <code>tables</code>. They were
          only ever intended to be used to present “tabular data”, meaning data
          that is inherently two-dimensional. 
          <br>The intentions of the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization responsible for publishing
          web standards) were ignored by developers, however. Web site creators
          quickly adopted tables as a means of control page layout. Indeed,
          tables provided nearly the same level of control that traditional
          publishers enjoyed.<br>HTML 3.2, published on May 5, 1996, and
          recommended as a standard in January 1997, introduced design elements
          such as <code>fonts</code>, <code>colors</code>, and <code>background</code> elements. This development marked the birth of the modern web designer. Suddenly, web pages were
          no longer about pure content alone, and <b>presentation became king</b><a href="https://educationecosystem.com/guides/programming/html-css/history#:~:text=HTML%2FCSS%20History,1995%2C%20and%20it%20brought%20images."> (<i>Link to the full article)</i>.</a>

        the identity of the company, i.e. use the bird logo for Twitter, etc.
        Demonstrate use of Flex box to place these icons space evenly and
