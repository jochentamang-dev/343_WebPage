        Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow, yeah. Everywhere
        the child went, The little lamb was sure to go, yeah. He followed her to
        school one day, And broke the teacher's rule. What a time did they have,
        That day at school. Tisket, tasket, A green and yellow basket. Sent a
        letter to my baby, On my way I passed it. Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in
        the sky. When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then
        you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. Then the
        traveller in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark, He could not see
        which way to go, If you did not twinkle so. In the dark blue sky you
        keep, And often through my curtains peep, For you never shut your eye,
        ‘Till the sun is in the sky. As your bright and tiny spark, Lights the
        traveller in the dark. Though I know not what you are, Twinkle, twinkle,
        little star. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are.
        Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle,
        little star. How I wonder what you are. How I wonder what you are. ‘Row
        Row Row Your Boat’ has just one stanza, with four lines: Row, row, row
        your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life
        is but a dream Other versions of the lyrics can be created off the cuff,
        and many of these have been passed on and stuck over time. You may have
        come across other words, including the fun versions that bring various
        animals in, below: Row, row, row your boat Gently up the creek If you
        see a little mouse Don’t forget to squeak! Row, row, row your boat
        Gently down the stream If you see a crocodile Don’t forget to scream!
        Row, row, row your boat Gently to the shore If you see a lion Don’t
        forget to roar! Baby Shark, doo-doo, doo-doo Baby Shark, doo-doo,
        doo-doo Baby Shark, doo-doo, doo-doo Baby Shark Mommy Shark, doo-doo,

        <h3>Jochen Tamang</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="area-3 child-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Main Layout: I made "parent-container" as the parent of a grid for
            seven grid child elements. I changed the background-color of those
            child to see if my layout was correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Header Layout: I made a seperate <code>div</code> for the header
            name. Then, I made another <code>div</code> for image and header
            found on top of the page. I added css to the image to make it float
            right, have spacing, and be a smaller size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Area 1: After adding the image to area-1, I added CSS to image to
            make it have height of 100% and width of auto. Then, I made area-1
            into a flexbox, which meant img element is a child of that flexbox.
            By adding justify-content to center for area-1, I was able to center
            the image horizontally. Note, since height was already 100% for
            image, I didn't have to center the image vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Area 2: I added the phone img inside the h4 element to make the
            image next to the phone number. I also made area-2 into a flex to
            align all the child elements vertically and horizontally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Area 4: To make the table, I used <code>table</code>,
            <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code> elements. To
            make the table rows pattern, I used :nth-child(row or even) to give
            even and odd rows different color. I used :nth-child(1) to make the
            header have a different color from the rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Area 5: For the image, I made the width be 100% and height be auto
            to make it fit into the div space. Next, I made area-5 be a flex
            parent, so I could vertically center the child (img). There was no
            need to align the img horizontally, since the width is 100%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Are 6,7: These are pretty self-explanatory. For area-6, I used
            a:visited pseudo element to make a text not change color if the link
            was visited. I also used a:hover to make the text change color if we
            hover over the text.
          </li>
          <li>
            Area 8: After adding <code>img</code> inside the
            <code>a</code> element, I turned area-8 into a flexbox. By using
            justify-content and align-items, I centered the images with link
            vertically and horizontally.

          At its inception in 1990, <strong>HTML</strong> was only intended to
          provide structure for text-based documents. It had a concept of
          multiple levels of headings and of body text, but not much else.<br /><b
            >HTML 2.0</b
          >
          was released in April 1994 and approved by the W3C as a standard in
          September of 1995, and it brought images. Developers were given very
          little control over how images were displayed. In fact, image tags
          supported only two attributes: One for the image source (providing a
          URL than the image could be downloaded from) and one for the alt text
          (a message to be shown to the user if the image could not be displayed
          for some reason). <br /><b>HTML 3.0</b>, released in November 1993,
          added <code>tables</code>. They were only ever intended to be used to
          present “tabular data”, meaning data that is inherently
          two-dimensional. <br />The intentions of the W3C (the World Wide Web
          Consortium, the organization responsible for publishing web standards)
          were ignored by developers, however. Web site creators quickly adopted
          tables as a means of control page layout. Indeed, tables provided
          nearly the same level of control that traditional publishers
          enjoyed.<br /><b>HTML 3.2</b>, published on May 5, 1996, and
          recommended as a standard in January 1997, introduced design elements
          such as <code>fonts</code>, <code>colors</code>, and
          <code>background</code> elements. This development marked the birth of
          the modern web designer. Suddenly, web pages were no longer about pure
          content alone, and <b>presentation became king</b
