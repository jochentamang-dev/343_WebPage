        Hello world, my name is Jochen Tamang. I'm a CS major at GVSU :) One interesting fact about me is I was born in a country called Nepal in South Asia, and I moved to the U.S. when I was 10. In my free time, I enjoy watching shows on netflix, learning about new technologies, and hanging out with my puppy, Fiona. I'm trying to make this paragraph longer, so I will blabber about myself for a bit more. I have some experience with HTML and basic CSS. I have used bootstrap library for CSS in the past. In this class, I want to learn more about creating web application/page faster with JS frameworks. I also hope to learn about other CSS libraries like tailwind, which has been big on twitter lately. Lastly, I hope to learn any and everything about backend. Currently, I have pretty much no experience working with the backend, as well as how to connect the server side to client side. CIS 371 so far has been really interesting and fun for me. I have always liked the web development side of computer science. I definitely see myself working as a web developer in the future. I hope this class will jumpstart my career in web development. Alright, just a bit more sentences left to showcase that this paragraph will wrap around my photo. Fun fact about my picture, it was taken last winter in millenium park by my cousin. Ok, I have run out of things to say, I have decided to make the picture little bit smaller. Thanks for reading! Never mind, changing the size made my picture too small. I will just keep typing to show that the text will wrap around the image. Let me talk about what was the hardest part of this assignment. For me, the "hardest" part was figuring out align-content, align-items, justify-content, etc. They all sound the same to me. I still need to look up which one is which to make sure I'm using the correct CSS property for grid and flexbox. One last thing, the picture in area 1 is a picture from my country. It's a picture of Buddhist prayer wheel. ALRIGHT, THANKS FOR READING IF YOU DID! Sorry for wasting your time.

        <ol>
          <li>Main Layout: I made "parent-container" as the parent of a grid for seven grid child elements. I changed the background-color of those child to see if my layout was correct.</li>
          <li>Header Layout: I made a seperate <code>div</code> for the header name. Then, I made another <code>div</code> for image and header found on top of the page. I added css to the image to make it float right, have spacing, and be a smaller size. </li>
          <li>Area 1: After adding the image to area-1, I added CSS to image to make it have height of 100% and width of auto. Then, I made area-1 into a flexbox, which meant img element is a child of that flexbox. By adding justify-content to center for area-1, I was able to center the image horizontally. Note, since height was already 100% for image, I didn't have to center the image vertically.</li>
          <li>Area 2: I added the phone img inside the h4 element to make the image next to the phone number. I also made area-2 into a flex to align all the child elements vertically and horizontally.</li>
          <li>Area 4: To make the table, I used <code>table</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code> elements. To make the table rows pattern, I used :nth-child(row or even) to give even and odd rows different color. I used :nth-child(1) to make the header have a different color from the rest.</li>
          <li>Area 5: For the image, I made the width be 100% and height be auto to make it fit into the div space. Next, I made area-5 be a flex parent, so I could vertically center the child (img). There was no need to align the img horizontally, since the width is 100%.</li>
          <li>Are 6,7: These are pretty self-explanatory. For area-6, I used a:visited pseudo element to make a text not change color if the link was visited. I also used a:hover to make the text change color if we hover over the text. </li>
          <li>Area 8: After adding <code>img</code> inside the <code>a</code> element, I turned area-8 into a flexbox. By using justify-content and align-items, I centered the images with link vertically and horizontally. </li>
        </ol>

          At its inception in 1990, <strong>HTML</strong> was only intended to
          provide structure for text-based documents. It had a concept of
          multiple levels of headings and of body text, but not much else.<br /><b
            >HTML 2.0</b
          >
          was released in April 1994 and approved by the W3C as a standard in
          September of 1995, and it brought images. Developers were given very
          little control over how images were displayed. In fact, image tags
          supported only two attributes: One for the image source (providing a
          URL than the image could be downloaded from) and one for the alt text
          (a message to be shown to the user if the image could not be displayed
          for some reason). <br /><b>HTML 3.0</b>, released in November 1993,
          added <code>tables</code>. They were only ever intended to be used to
          present “tabular data”, meaning data that is inherently
          two-dimensional. <br />The intentions of the W3C (the World Wide Web
          Consortium, the organization responsible for publishing web standards)
          were ignored by developers, however. Web site creators quickly adopted
          tables as a means of control page layout. Indeed, tables provided
          nearly the same level of control that traditional publishers
          enjoyed.<br /><b>HTML 3.2</b>, published on May 5, 1996, and
          recommended as a standard in January 1997, introduced design elements
          such as <code>fonts</code>, <code>colors</code>, and
          <code>background</code> elements. This development marked the birth of
          the modern web designer. Suddenly, web pages were no longer about pure
          content alone, and <b>presentation became king</b
