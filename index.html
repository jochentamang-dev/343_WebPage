        <ol>
          <li>Main Layout: I made "parent-container" as the parent of a grid for seven grid child elements. I changed the background-color of those child to see if my layout was correct.</li>
          <li>Header Layout: I made a seperate <code>div</code> for the header name. Then, I made another <code>div</code> for image and header found on top of the page. I added css to the image to make it float right, have spacing, and be a smaller size. </li>
          <li>Area 1: After adding the image to area-1, I added CSS to image to make it have height of 100% and width of auto. Then, I made area-1 into a flexbox, which meant img element is a child of that flexbox. By adding justify-content to center for area-1, I was able to center the image horizontally. Note, since height was already 100% for image, I didn't have to center the image vertically.</li>
          <li>Area 2: I added the phone img inside the h4 element to make the image next to the phone number. I also made area-2 into a flex to align all the child elements vertically and horizontally.</li>
          <li>Area 4: To make the table, I used <code>table</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code> elements. To make the table rows pattern, I used :nth-child(row or even) to give even and odd rows different color. I used :nth-child(1) to make the header have a different color from the rest.</li>
          <li>Area 5: For the image, I made the width be 100% and height be auto to make it fit into the div space. Next, I made area-5 be a flex parent, so I could vertically center the child (img). There was no need to align the img horizontally, since the width is 100%.</li>
          <li>Are 6,7: These are pretty self-explanatory. For area-6, I used a:visited pseudo element to make a text not change color if the link was visited. I also used a:hover to make the text change color if we hover over the text. </li>
          <li>Area 8: After adding <code>img</code> inside the <code>a</code> element, I turned area-8 into a flexbox. By using justify-content and align-items, I centered the images with link vertically and horizontally. </li>

          At its inception in 1990, <strong>HTML</strong> was only intended to
          provide structure for text-based documents. It had a concept of
          multiple levels of headings and of body text, but not much else.<br /><b
            >HTML 2.0</b
          >
          was released in April 1994 and approved by the W3C as a standard in
          September of 1995, and it brought images. Developers were given very
          little control over how images were displayed. In fact, image tags
          supported only two attributes: One for the image source (providing a
          URL than the image could be downloaded from) and one for the alt text
          (a message to be shown to the user if the image could not be displayed
          for some reason). <br /><b>HTML 3.0</b>, released in November 1993,
          added <code>tables</code>. They were only ever intended to be used to
          present “tabular data”, meaning data that is inherently
          two-dimensional. <br />The intentions of the W3C (the World Wide Web
          Consortium, the organization responsible for publishing web standards)
          were ignored by developers, however. Web site creators quickly adopted
          tables as a means of control page layout. Indeed, tables provided
          nearly the same level of control that traditional publishers
          enjoyed.<br /><b>HTML 3.2</b>, published on May 5, 1996, and
          recommended as a standard in January 1997, introduced design elements
          such as <code>fonts</code>, <code>colors</code>, and
          <code>background</code> elements. This development marked the birth of
          the modern web designer. Suddenly, web pages were no longer about pure
          content alone, and <b>presentation became king</b
